An email to the board member of the {} Association of {} named {}. Now imagine this is the end of the paragraph.

    Now imagine this is the start of another paragraph. Now this paragraph, like all paragraphs, must come to an end.

    Fear not! The ending of one paragraph is the start of another (usually). It is with eyes to the future that the letter concludes.
