Declining membership in fraternity chapters drives vacancy in the chapter house and reduces revenue. This creates a vicious cycle in which:<br>
BULLETthere is less money invested in recruitment, impacting membership<br>
maintenance of the chapter house is deferred, also impacting membership<br>
ENDBULLET<br>
After graduating from UCLA Greek life I founded Clean Floors & Locking Doors to eliminate vacancy in fraternity houses. At UCLA we tripled our first client’s summer revenue in summers 2018 and 2019. At USC we’ve increased rent income by 80% in the middle of a pandemic that’s pushed the university online. <br>
<br>
As an alumni volunteer you likely have many commitments outside the chapter. Our process is designed to make your role in filling vacancies as simple as signing a lease. <br>
