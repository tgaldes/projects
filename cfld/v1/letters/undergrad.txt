Chapters that struggled with recruitment in 2020 are poised to have bad occupancy numbers in the fall. The company I started, Clean Floors & Locking Doors, exists so that house corps don’t need to stress about vacancy. I’m reaching out to see where the {} chapter of {} stands for occupancy during the next school year and if there’s an opportunity for us to help.
 
In 2020 a client at USC has increased their revenue 80% spring semester by working with us, even with covid pushing the university online. At SJSU the house corp is collecting $4,675 a month from tenants referred by CF&LD and investing that money into growing the chapter.

As an undergraduate volunteer you likely have many commitments to the chapter. Our tenant referral process makes your job as simple as signing a lease. 

Clean Floors & Locking Doors achieves this by:
BULLETadvertising where college-aged renters look
handling all the back and forth with interested tenants
running background and credit checks 
sending out electronic leases
putting you in touch with the tenant once they are ready to pay a deposit
ENDBULLET
{} If {} is in need of outside renters, I'm here to make that happen.

Best,
