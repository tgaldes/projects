	Declining membership in fraternity chapters drives vacancy in the chapter house and reduces revenue. This creates a vicious cycle in which:
BULLETthere is less money invested in recruitment, impacting membership
maintenance of the chapter house is deferred, also impacting membership
ENDBULLET
	After graduating from UCLA Greek life I founded Clean Floors & Locking Doors to eliminate vacancy in fraternity houses. At UCLA we tripled our first client’s summer revenue in summers 2018 and 2019. At USC we’ve increased rent income by 80% in the middle of a pandemic that’s pushed the university online. 

	As an alumni volunteer you likely have many commitments outside the chapter. Our process is designed to minimize your involvement.
Clean Floors & Locking Doors:
BULLETadvertises where college-aged renters look
handles all the back and forth with interested tenants
does background and credit checks 
sends out electronic leases
collects rent and deposits
ENDBULLETYour job is as simple as signing a lease.

	I’m reaching out to see if the {} chapter of {} has a vacancy problem that you want to solve. You can take a picture of the code below to see some of what we’ve put together for our current clients. If you prefer a more direct approach, email me at tyler@cleanfloorslockingdoors.com and we’ll schedule a time to talk on the phone.
