Dear Mr. {},

I’m reaching out on behalf of Clean Floors & Locking Doors, a company that believes it should be easy for fraternity house corps with great chapter houses to generate revenue- regardless of member count, university restrictions, or global pandemics.

The foundation for the financial position of every house corps is a chapter house that is bringing in rent. Clean Floors & Locking Doors was founded to eliminate vacancy in fraternity houses by providing a professional year round advertising service that caters to Greek life. We advertise where interested college-aged renters look, are the point of contact for them as they ask questions about living in, conduct background checks, and send out leases to be signed by the tenant and house corp.

We’ve identified {} as a new area where we could provide value to a client during both the academic year and summer. I am reaching out to see if the {} chapter of {} foresees a need to rent space in its chapter house to outside tenants. The client we can provide the most value to has a great chapter house and with a few rooms that are vacant or under occupied during the school year or summer. You can scan the code below with the camera on your phone to see what we’ve put together for our current clients at UCLA, USC, UMN, and SJSU. 

If you are interested in discussing the possibility of working together, please reach out to me at tyler@cleanfloorslockingdoors.com, and we can schedule a time to talk on the phone.

Best,
Tyler Galdes
