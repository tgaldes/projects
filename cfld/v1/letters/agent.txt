Fraternity chapters that struggled with recruitment in 2020 are poised to have bad occupancy numbers in the fall. The company I started, Clean Floors & Locking Doors, exists so that house corps don’t need to stress about vacancy. I’m reaching out to see where the {} chapter of {} stands for occupancy during the next school year and if there’s an opportunity for us to help.
 
In 2020 a client at USC increased their revenue 80% by working with us, even with covid pushing the university online. At SJSU a client is collecting $4,675 a month from tenants referred by CF&LD and investing that money into growing the chapter.

The alumni volunteers likely have many commitments outside the chapter. Our tenant referral process makes their job as simple as signing a lease. 

Clean Floors & Locking Doors achieves this by:
BULLETproducing ads targeted to college-aged renters on the platforms they frequent
handling all the communication and sales effort with interested tenants
running background and credit checks 
sending out electronic leases
putting the required person in touch with the tenant once they are ready to pay a deposit
ENDBULLET
{} If {} is in need of outside renters, you can take a picture of the qr code below or email me for more information.

Best,
