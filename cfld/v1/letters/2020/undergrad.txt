Declining membership in fraternity chapters drives vacancy in the chapter house and reduces revenue. This creates a vicious cycle in which:
BULLETthere is less money invested in recruitment, impacting membership
there is less money for awesome events, also impacting membership
ENDBULLET
After graduating from UCLA Greek life I founded Clean Floors & Locking Doors to eliminate vacancy in fraternity houses. At UCLA we tripled our first client’s summer revenue in summers 2018 and 2019. At USC we’ve increased rent income by 80% in the middle of a pandemic that’s pushed the university online. 

Our process works fast enough for you to enjoy the results while you are still an undergraduate.

Clean Floors & Locking Doors:
BULLETadvertises where college-aged renters look
handles all the back and forth with interested tenants
does background and credit checks 
sends out electronic leases
collects rent and deposits

I’m reaching out to{} see if the {} chapter of {} is interested in having more money available for chapter operations. You can take a picture of the qr code below to get more details on how we can work for you and see what we’ve done for our current clients. If you prefer a more direct approach, email me at tyler@cf-ld.com, and we can schedule a call with you and a member of the house corporation.
