Declining membership in fraternity chapters drives vacancy in the chapter house and reduces revenue. This creates a vicious cycle in which:
BULLETthere is less money invested in recruitment, impacting membership
maintenance of the chapter house is deferred, also impacting membership
ENDBULLET
After graduating from UCLA Greek life I founded Clean Floors & Locking Doors to eliminate vacancy in fraternity houses. At UCLA we tripled our first client’s summer revenue in summers 2018 and 2019. At USC we’ve increased rent income by 80% in the middle of a pandemic that’s pushed the university online. 

I’m reaching out to{} get in touch with a member of the house corporation for the {} chapter of {} to see if they are interested in improving their bottom line. The alumni volunteers likely have many commitments outside the chapter. Our process is designed to make their job as simple as signing a lease. 

Clean Floors & Locking Doors:
BULLETadvertises where college-aged renters look
handles all the back and forth with interested tenants
does background and credit checks 
sends out electronic leases
collects rent and deposits
