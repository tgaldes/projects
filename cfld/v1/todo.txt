update column names in real sheet
start reading from real sheet while we aren't writing out data?


Epics
1) send mail as tyler@cfld.com
2) sendgrid api
3) data persistence schema and to docs
4) letter writing
5) UI integration


To make more robust:
- exponential backoff while making api requests so that we can handle a server error code 500 httperror
    https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas/details;servicem=docs.googleapis.com;metricm=docs.googleapis.com%2Fwrite_requests;limitIdm=1%2Fmin%2F%7Bproject%7D%2F%7Buser%7D?authuser=2&project=cfldv1

next steps:
    - try out letter with tagline (better without)
    - review letter with sam
    - think about website layout- what new pages will we need?
    - QR code by code (house/undergrad/board/etc)
        - also think about if we want all the people hitting the same page on the website we should set up redirects so that undergrads/vs board members are hitting different links and getting redirected to the same landing page
            - even better, we can do a redirect by school/fraternity as well, so the QR code link will be something like cfld.com/smu-kappa-sigma
        - to get really fancy: A/B testing, can hold enum, QR code image link, webpage link, in google sheet, then add which qr code they got in their letter to the mail_dates column update call
