update column names in real sheet
start reading from real sheet while we aren't writing out data?


Epics
1) send mail as tyler@cfld.com
2) sendgrid api
3) data persistence schema and to docs
4) letter writing
5) UI integration


To make more robust:
- globally visible function that's always used to access values of NamedTuples (like contact info that COULD have been populated with fields from a House) so that we can use backup keys to redirect to the fields we want for a house/other class

next steps:
    email sender interfaces w/ no sendgrid, will be able to extract out a little bit of the work
    that we do when we track what mail is being sent out
