update column names in real sheet
start reading from real sheet while we aren't writing out data?


Epics
1) send mail as tyler@cfld.com
2) sendgrid api
3) data persistence schema and to docs
4) letter writing
5) UI integration


To make more robust:
- exponential backoff while making api requests so that we can handle a server error code 500 httperror
    https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas/details;servicem=docs.googleapis.com;metricm=docs.googleapis.com%2Fwrite_requests;limitIdm=1%2Fmin%2F%7Bproject%7D%2F%7Buser%7D?authuser=2&project=cfldv1
- globally visible function that's always used to access values of NamedTuples (like contact info that COULD have been populated with fields from a House) so that we can use backup keys to redirect to the fields we want for a house/other class

next steps:
    figure out where we want to hold the codes that we aren't sending out mail for (for example, we wouldn't want to send mail to a client marked as 'skip')
