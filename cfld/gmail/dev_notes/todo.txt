might not want to throw in the 'get_lease_sent_out_emails' func - what does this mean ??
if I do a make them say no off a tour email, I would rather not have the people added in the tour info get the make them say no. proper way to do this would be to cc those people in the tour email so I can specify reply all = false in thread.recipients


rule additions

#2- can we change up how we are querying emails so that a rule like makethemsayno will get a chance to act on a thread on every iteration?
    we could split that rule into two and query for 3rd_party and automation/contact_form labels
    - add 'not 'automation/make_them_say_no' in thread.labels()' to the expression matcher and then we could use force_query and not need to worry about checking on the same thread many times
    - something like a 24 hr reset when we drop all the finalized history ids and will re process all the rules (that should be ok since we can kill and restart the process w/ it not getting stuff messed up due to double processing)

DEV ADDITIONS-

drafts:
I think we can hide this from the thread / service interface if we have gmail apply the actions across all drafts for a given thread. don't see many use cases for multiple drafts we want to maintain per thread. this will wait until if/when we are writing a service for another email client and that email client doesn't have the same draft/thread model as gmail
