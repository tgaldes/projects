might not want to throw in the 'get_lease_sent_out_emails' func - what does this mean ??
if I do a make them say no off a tour email, I would rather not have the people added in the tour info get the make them say no. proper way to do this would be to cc those people in the tour email so I can specify reply all = false in thread.recipients


rule additions

1- instead of immediately archiving 'Your signature is requrired' emails, we can leave them in the inbox and then archive them once the signed lease email for that tenant comes in, that way they stay as a reminder for me to sign the lease
