6 integration test for subject match -> draft action -> automation label -> send -> automation unlabel




Medium value
- test all matchers / rules at runtime with empty thread, good check of syntax from google sheet
Long term low priority and low value tickets:
- set the 'automation' label at the message level so our automation won't touch user created drafts, but will instead create it's own drafts in the threads
- we shouldn't force the user to specify rules in a monotonically increasing sequence, nor should they need to specify a group for every rule
