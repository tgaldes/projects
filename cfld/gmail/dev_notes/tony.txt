projects-

0) update paths of .pickle files to ./tokens

1) testing refactor
    - pull out locals that are reused to instance vars
    - TestConfig:
        - sets up logger to level DEBUG
        - defines parent_path var
    - hold any functions shared by tests in the same TestConfig.py file
    - Mocks.py:
        - create an IService interface, implemented by GMail service class
        - create a MockService class that also implements this interface, and comes with default return values (use the ones you find common in a few test cases)
            - individual tests can still override these return values if they want to 

2) enum values for rulegrouptype
    - Enums.py will have enum values for rule group type
        - value can be 'ifelse' 'ifany' or '', the empty string will be the default and map to ifany
    - reference - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41407414/convert-string-to-enum-in-python
    - we can use the enum value instead of hardcoding the strings in RuleFactory and RuleGroup.py

3) new test cases: 
    - use ./run_coverage.sh to see a report of which lines we don't hit in our unit tests 
    - write test cases to hit those lines in each file

4) group numbers in rulefactory- enforce a blank line in the sheet to separate rule groups instead of forcing the user to specify a monotonically increasing list of numbers
