We make this a reality by connecting college aged persons looking for seasonal housing to seasonal openings in fraternities- advertising, professionally handling the back and forth with potential tenants, signing leases, collecting rent, and taking care of any and every tenant issue that comes up over the summer (you can check out an example of our work at 649gayley.com). We are looking to expand beyond UCLA to other campuses in high demand areas, such as target_2, for summer of 2020.\n\nThe client we can provide the most value to has a small chapter, and full sized chapter house which they struggle to fill during the summer- resorting to renting below the market rate or decreasing the occupancy of rooms over the break. For example, a prospective client at SJSU has a 50 person fraternity house that has brought in roughly $10,000 per month over summer in recent years. We are optimistic that we will be able to double that income, AFTER management costs, meaning an extra $30,000 in the association's bank account at the end of summer.\n\nIf the target_0 chapter of target_1 fits this profile, I would love to discuss your current summer operations to see if working with Clean Floors & Locking Doors would be a benefit to you. I can be reached at tyler@cleanfloorslockingdoors.com.\n\nBest,\nTyler Galdes\nClean Floors & Locking Doors", \

"\n\n\n\ntarget_3\n\n\n\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nI'm reaching out on behalf of Clean Floors & Locking Doors Inc to discuss helping the target_0 chapter of target_1 build for its future by drastically increasing the amount of revenue collected annually from the chapter house.\n\nClean Floors & Locking Doors believes that fraternities in urban areas should generate significant amounts of revenue during the academic year and summer, regardless of chapter size. We make this a reality by connecting college aged persons looking for housing to openings in fraternities- advertising, professionally handling the back and forth with potential tenants, signing leases, collecting rent, and keeping tenants happy while they are living at the house. You can check out an example of work we've done for a client that needed help filling their chapter house over summer at 649gayley.com. We are looking to expand beyond UCLA to other campuses in high demand areas, such as target_2.\n\nThe client we can provide the most benefit to has a small or suspended chapter and full sized chapter house which they struggle to fill- resorting to renting their rooms below the market rate or decreasing the occupancy of rooms. For example, a prospective client at SJSU has a 50 person fraternity house that has brought in only $10,000 per month over summer in recent years. By working with Clean Floors & Locking Doors over summer, we are optimistic that they will be able to double that income, AFTER management costs, meaning an extra $30,000 in the association's bank account after three months.\n\nI saw that the target_1 chapter was recently suspended from target_0. If you have been collecting less income from the property since this event, I would love to discuss your current operations to see if working with Clean Floors & Locking Doors would benefit your chapter.\n\n\nBest,\nTyler Galdes\nClean Floors & Locking Doors"]
